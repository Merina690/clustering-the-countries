Clustering the countries Using Unsupervised Learning
This project is to help the NGOs in knowing the underdeveloping and developing countries to fight against their poverty. The unsupervised techniques like k means, Hierarchical clustering,PCA helps in clustering the countries in an efficient way.

ðŸ›  Skills
Unsupervised Learning Techniques: PCA, k-means clustering, DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering

Importing the libraries
import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as shc

Lesson Learned
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.

It helps in cluster the population in an effective way. I have used k-means and hierarchical, which works similar.
